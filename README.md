# IOTA Pico Framework Core

Helper classes and core interface definitions.

# Installation

```shell
npm install @iota-pico/core --save
```

# Documentation

Documentation for the code can be found in [docs](./docs/README.md) folder.

# Library

The IOTA Pico Framework is a multi-layered set of object oriented JavaScript libraries for use with the IOTA tangle.

If you don't want to use the layered versions of the libraries consider using the  ready bundled versions:
* [@iota-pico/lib-browser](https://github.com/iota-pico/lib-browser)
* [@iota-pico/lib-nodejs](https://github.com/iota-pico/lib-nodejs)

Each layer is fully abstracted allowing you to replace components with your own implementations very easily.

The layered libraries are written in TypeScript so are all strongly typed. The modules are generated as ES6 so you may need to transpile them when including them for use in older JavaScript eco-systems. The code will run without transpilation in all modern browsers and when used by NodeJs.
